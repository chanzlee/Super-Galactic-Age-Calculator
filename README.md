# _Super Galactic Age Calculator_

#### by _Chan Lee_ , 10/12/2018

## Description

This program provide information about users in different planet in our solar system (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter) based on users' inputs. A solar year lasts 365 days on planet Earth. However, the length of a solar year varies from planet to planet. Information includes users age on each planet, life expectancy, and day until upcoming birthday in Earth time.

## Behavior-driven Development

Returns their age in Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
Returns their age in Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)
Determines how many years a user has left to live on each planet… (yikes!) To do this, the application will have to calculate the user’s life expectancy. You can determine average life expectancy as you see fit. A simple way to do this would be to have the user input the average life expectancy for their demographic. A more involved way to do this would be to collect other information from the user (e.g. lifestyle, country of residence, activity level, etc.) to determine their life expectancy.
If a user has already surpassed the average life expectancy, return the number of years they have lived past the life expectancy.
